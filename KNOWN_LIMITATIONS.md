## 🔶 MODERATE PRIORITY LIMITATIONS

### 1. Build Warnings

**Category:** Build Process  
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Impact:** Code quality concern, no functional impact

**Description:**
Build process produces warnings about CSS syntax and bundle size.

**Details:**
```
▲ [WARNING] Unexpected "#3D-Floorplan" [css-syntax-error]
    css/app.css:54:0:
      54 │ #3D-Floorplan, #floorplanner-canvas {
         ╵ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.
dist/assets/index-DOvuaGHP.js  1,008.79 kB │ gzip: 257.87 kB
```

**Root Cause:**
1. CSS ID selector starting with digit (#3D-Floorplan) - invalid per CSS spec
2. Large bundle size (987KB) - no code splitting implemented

**Impact:**
- Warning only - build completes successfully
- CSS still renders correctly in all browsers
- Large bundle may cause slower initial load on slow connections
- Gzipped size (257KB) is acceptable for most use cases

**Workaround:**
- None needed - warnings don't affect functionality
- For slow connections, consider enabling browser caching

**Planned Fix:**
- v0.2.0: Rename CSS ID to valid identifier (#floorplan-3d or #_3D-Floorplan)
- v0.3.0: Implement code splitting to reduce bundle size

### 2. Development-Time Security Vulnerabilities

**Category:** Security  
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Impact:** Development environment only

**Description:**
NPM audit reports 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies.

**Details:**
```
esbuild <=0.24.2 (MODERATE)
  - Issue: Enables any website to send requests to dev server
  - GHSA: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
  - CVE: Not assigned
  - Severity: MODERATE (CVSS 5.3)

vite 0.11.0 - 6.1.6 (MODERATE)
  - Depends on vulnerable esbuild version
```

**Root Cause:**
Development dependencies (esbuild, vite) have known vulnerabilities affecting dev server.

**Impact:**
- **Development only** - does NOT affect production build
- Dev server could potentially be exploited if exposed to internet
- Production bundle built with these tools is NOT vulnerable
- No runtime security risk in deployed application

**Workaround:**
- Only run dev server on localhost
- Don't expose dev server (port 5173) to public internet
- Use production build for any public deployment

**Planned Fix:**
- v0.2.0: Update vite to v7.3.1+ (requires major version upgrade)
- May require code changes for vite v7 compatibility

**Security Assessment:**
✅ ACCEPTABLE FOR v0.1.0 RELEASE
- Vulnerabilities are dev-time only
- Production build is secure
- Clear mitigation strategy exists

### 3. No Auto-Snap During Drag

**Category:** User Experience  
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Impact:** Manual workflow required

**Description:**
Items don't automatically snap to grid or standard dimensions while dragging. User must manually click "Snap to Cabinet Size" button after placement.

**Details:**
- Snap logic is implemented and tested (28 tests pass)
- snapValue() function works correctly
- Manual snap button exists and functions
- Auto-snap during drag not implemented

**Impact:**
- User must perform two-step process: place item → click snap button
- Easy to create non-standard dimensions accidentally
- Reduces efficiency for power users
- May lead to inconsistent layouts

**Workaround:**
1. Place item approximately where desired
2. Click "✨ Snap to Cabinet Size" button in properties panel
3. Item will snap to nearest standard width/height/depth

**Planned Fix:**
- Phase 4: Implement auto-snap during drag operations
- Add visual feedback for snap points (highlighted grid)
- Add Shift key override to disable snapping temporarily

---

### 4. No Visual Collision Warnings

**Category:** User Experience  
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Impact:** Can create invalid designs

**Description:**
Collision detection logic is implemented and tested, but no visual warnings shown in UI when items overlap.

**Details:**
- Collision detection code exists and works (14 tests pass)
- Bounding box intersection logic functional
- No UI integration - users not warned about overlaps
- Items can be placed on top of each other

**Impact:**
- Users can create physically impossible layouts
- No indication when items intersect walls or other items
- May lead to designs that can't be built in real life
- Frustrating when users discover overlap later

**Workaround:**
1. Manually check item positions visually
2. Use 2D floorplan view to verify no overlaps
3. Zoom in to inspect tight spaces
4. Check from multiple angles in 3D view

**Planned Fix:**
- Phase 4: Add visual collision warnings
- Highlight overlapping items in red
- Show warning icon in properties panel
- Optional: Prevent placement in invalid positions

---

### 5. No Catalog Search UI

**Category:** User Experience  
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Impact:** Poor usability with large catalog

**Description:**
Catalog contains 200+ items but has no search box or filter UI. Search logic is implemented and tested, but not exposed to users.

**Details:**
- Search/filter logic exists and works (22 tests pass)
- filterByName() supports case-insensitive partial matching
- Category filter logic implemented
- No UI controls in catalog modal

**Impact:**
- Users must scroll through all 200+ items to find specific item
- Time-consuming to locate specific cabinet or appliance
- Reduced productivity
- Poor user experience

**Workaround:**
1. Use browser Find (Ctrl+F) on catalog modal
2. Remember approximate position of frequently used items
3. Use category tabs (Floor Items, Wall Items, In-Wall Items) to narrow down

**Planned Fix:**
- Phase 4: Add search input box to catalog modal
- Add real-time filtering as user types
- Add category filter buttons
- Add "Recently Used" section for quick access
