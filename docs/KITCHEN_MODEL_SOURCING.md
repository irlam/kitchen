# Free modern kitchen model sources for this project

## What format your project uses

From the codebase:

- Catalog entries currently point to `.glb` files under `models/gltf/` and declare `format: "gltf"`.
- Runtime loading supports both `gltf` and `obj` metadata formats.
- The import helper defaults to `--format gltf` and writes models into `models/gltf/`.

**Recommendation:** Prefer **GLB/GLTF** assets for new kitchen items. OBJ can work, but GLB is the safest match for your existing catalog + pipeline.

## Best free sources (modern kitchen units/appliances)

> Always check each model's exact license on its model page before using commercially.

### 1. **Sketchfab (downloadable models filter)**
- Link: https://sketchfab.com/search?features=downloadable&licenses=cc0&sort_by=-likeCount&type=models&q=kitchen%20cabinet
- Good for: modern cabinets, islands, extractor hoods, decor
- Formats: often GLB/GLTF, OBJ, FBX (varies per asset)

### 2. **CGTrader free models**
- Link: https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models?keywords=kitchen%20cabinet
- Good for: kitchen units, appliance packs
- Formats: GLB/GLTF sometimes available; OBJ/FBX very common

### 3. **Poly Pizza / Google Poly Archive mirror packs**
- Link: https://poly.pizza/search/kitchen
- Good for: lightweight stylized items and quick prototypes
- Formats: GLTF/GLB friendly

### 4. **Blend Swap**
- Link: https://www.blendswap.com/search?keyword=kitchen
- Good for: cabinet sets and scene components
- Formats: BLEND first; export to GLB from Blender if needed

### 5. **Free3D**
- Link: https://free3d.com/3d-models/kitchen
- Good for: appliances and accessory objects
- Formats: mixed (OBJ/FBX/3DS/BLEND; GLB less frequent)

## Fast shortlist to start with

Use these searches first to find modern assets that usually fit this planner style:

- "modern kitchen cabinet" (single base unit + wall unit variants)
- "kitchen island modern"
- "integrated fridge" / "built-in fridge"
- "induction cooktop"
- "wall oven"
- "minimal range hood"

## How to add one to this project

1. Download model as `.glb` if available.
2. Create/obtain a thumbnail image (`.png`).
3. Import using:

```bash
npm run import:item -- \
  --name "Modern Base Unit 600" \
  --model "./downloads/modern-base-unit-600.glb" \
  --image "./downloads/modern-base-unit-600.png" \
  --type 1 \
  --format gltf \
  --premium false \
  --register true
```

## Prompt to auto-add models (copy/paste)

Use this when you want an AI coding agent to do the full workflow end-to-end in this repo:

```text
You are working in /workspace/kitchen.

Task: Add the following kitchen catalog items automatically.

For each item below:
1) Download the model and thumbnail.
2) Import using `npm run import:item` with `--format gltf --register true`.
3) Keep model files in `models/gltf/` and thumbnails in `models/thumbnails_new/`.
4) Verify each item is appended in `src/items.js`.
5) Run a quick check that the new model and thumbnail files exist.
6) Commit changes with a clear message.

Items to import:
- Name: "Modern Base Unit 600", Type: 1, Premium: false, Model URL: "<PASTE_GLB_URL>", Image URL: "<PASTE_PNG_URL>"
- Name: "Modern Wall Unit 600", Type: 2, Premium: false, Model URL: "<PASTE_GLB_URL>", Image URL: "<PASTE_PNG_URL>"
- Name: "Minimal Range Hood", Type: 2, Premium: false, Model URL: "<PASTE_GLB_URL>", Image URL: "<PASTE_PNG_URL>"

Constraints:
- Prefer GLB assets only.
- If an item URL is invalid, skip it and report why.
- Do not edit unrelated files.
- After completion, print:
  - imported file paths
  - the exact new entries added to `src/items.js`
  - the commit hash
```

Tip: replace `<PASTE_GLB_URL>` and `<PASTE_PNG_URL>` with direct downloadable links.

## Preview options

- Quickest: use each source website's interactive model preview before downloading.
- In-project: after import, the item appears in your catalog with the imported thumbnail.
- If you want autogenerated thumbnails from GLB in-bulk, add a small renderer script later (Three.js headless screenshot pass) and store outputs in `models/thumbnails_new/`.
